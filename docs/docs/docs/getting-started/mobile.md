# Plugin Visibility in Mobile App

Some plugins extend their functionality to the Talawa Mobile App. When such a plugin is installed and enabled in the Admin Panel, it may unlock new screens, actions, or menu items for the users in that organisation.

## How It Works

- Mobile plugins are bundled with the app and activated remotely
- Once installed and enabled by an admin, the plugin becomes accessible to users without needing a separate update
- Users see new features in context — e.g., extra tabs, buttons, or sections

## Important Notes

- Plugins must be enabled in the **Admin Panel** to be visible on mobile
- The mobile app must be connected to the same organisation as the admin portal
- Disabled or uninstalled plugins are hidden from all users
- Some mobile plugin features may require internet access or permissions

By using plugins, organisations can dynamically control what features appear in the Talawa mobile experience — all without writing code or pushing updates.
