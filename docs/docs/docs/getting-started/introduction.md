# What are Talawa Plugins?

Talawa Plugins are add-ons that extend the functionality of your Talawa organization without changing the core application. Think of them like apps on your smartphone - each plugin adds specific features that you can turn on or off based on your needs.

## Why Use Plugins?

### Customization Without Coding
Plugins allow you to customize Talawa to fit your organization's unique needs without writing any code. Simply find a plugin that does what you need, install it, and activate it!

### Add Features On-Demand
Instead of having all features built-in (which makes the app heavy), plugins let you add only the features you need. This keeps your Talawa instance fast and focused.

### Easy to Manage
Don't need a feature anymore? Just deactivate or uninstall the plugin. No complicated processes, no leftover code cluttering your system.

### Safe and Isolated
Each plugin works independently. If one plugin has an issue, it won't affect the rest of your Talawa application or other plugins.

## Real-World Examples

Here are some practical examples of what plugins can do:

### Payment Plugin (e.g., Razorpay)
