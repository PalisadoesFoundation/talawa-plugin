Talawa Plugins allow organisations to extend the functionality of the Talawa platform by installing additional features when needed.

Plugins are modular and optional. They can be installed, activated, deactivated, or removed from the Admin Panel without affecting the core system.

## What You Can Do with Plugins

- Add support for online donations
- Integrate with external services (e.g., PayPal, Razorpay)
- Enable features like AI-based summaries, polls, or accessibility tools
- View new dashboards or panels inside the Admin Panel
- Enable new screens and flows in the mobile app (if supported)

## Plugin Types

Each plugin may contain components for:

- `Server` — Adds backend logic or APIs
- `Admin` — Adds or modifies pages in the Admin Panel
- `Mobile` — Adds or updates screens in the Talawa mobile app

Plugins are version-checked and isolated to ensure stability.

## Managing Plugins

Navigate to the **Plugins** section in the Admin Panel to:

- Browse available plugins
- Install or uninstall plugins
- Enable or disable installed plugins
- View plugin details

Only plugins compatible with your system version are shown.

## Notes

- Mobile plugins must be bundled in the app or updated through a build pipeline.

Plugins are optional, safe, and customisable — designed to help you tailor Talawa to your organisation’s needs.
